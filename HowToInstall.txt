Just run "sudo sh install.sh" in this directory. This automated script currently supports Ubuntu and Debian. If you encounter a problem while installing, check Installing Manually part of README

If you like to install only gdb itself, run "sudo sh install_gdb.sh". "install.sh" automatically runs this script if there's no gdb installed locally. Otherwise, it'll ask you if you would like to recompile&install gdb

To run PINCE after installation, run "sh PINCE.sh"

If you like to uninstall PINCE, just delete this folder. Almost everything is installed locally, including gdb. Config and user files of PINCE can be found in "~/.config/PINCE", you can manually delete them if you want.
