Just run "sudo sh install.sh" in this directory. This automated script currently supports Ubuntu and Debian. If you encounter a problem while installing, check Installing Manually part of README

If you like to install only gdb itself, run "sudo sh install_gdb.sh". "install.sh" automatically runs this script if there's no gdb installed locally. Otherwise, it'll ask you if you would like to recompile&install gdb

To run PINCE after installation, run "sh PINCE.sh"

If you like to uninstall PINCE, just delete this folder. Almost everything is installed locally, including gdb. There are only 2 exceptions: The ".gdbinit" file and the "PINCE_USER_FILES" file. They can be found at the home directory, delete them if you like to get rid of PINCE completely
